# Website-Template
Simple website, 3 pages with php navigation and contact form.

This template is for a resume and has an area for displaying code samples, front page resume and contact form.

### Usage
Hopefully the following instructions make it real easy otherwise just email me.

The background images currently in the Resouces folder are copywrited and need to be changed so not to infringe the copywrite,
code is free for you to use only (so long you give me credit).

Download files and make the following changes or enter the following data to give you a minimum website to add your own content to...

1.  Add a site title to the portfolio.php page
2.  Add a site title on Header.php
3.  Modify the Navigation headings to what you want in Header.php
4.  Add details to Contact_Body, instructions are given at the top of the page
5.  Put your own links in the footer, instructions at the top of Footer.php
6.  Change the faviocon and background images to something else (save them using my names if you do not wish to change the code to find your new images)

Almost done... 
Now simply add your own content to the pages called Resume.php (this is page 1 and home page) and Code.php (page 2)
