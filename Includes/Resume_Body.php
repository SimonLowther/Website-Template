            I have had a keen interest in astronomy from a young age which continues today. I have created a research observatory in my backyard with which
            I have contributed data to several significant projects and co-authored several papers published in noteworthy journals such as Astronomy and Astrophysics, and
            Astrophysical Journal. Prints of these are available on request.
